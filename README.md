# HWSensors
[GitHub](https://github.com/kozlek/HWSensors)

HWSensors is a software bundle that includes drivers and applications that allow you to access information from hardware sensors available on your Mac.

FakeSMC is an open source SMC device driver/emulator developed by [netkas](http://netkas.org).

##### NOTE: FakeSMC & Plugins starting from v915 provide additional sensors information to HWMonitor on Macs. By installing FakeSMC on a real Mac you acknowledge that you know what you are doing and how to recover your system if something goes wrong.
